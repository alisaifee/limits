----

**limits** is a python library for rate limiting via multiple strategies
with commonly used storage backends (Redis, Memcached, MongoDB & Etcd).

The library provides identical APIs for use in sync and
:ref:`async <async:async support>`  codebases.

Get started by taking a look at :ref:`installation:installation` and :ref:`quickstart:quickstart`.

To learn more about the different strategies refer to the :ref:`strategies:rate limiting strategies` section.

For an overview of supported backends refer to :ref:`storage:storage backends`.

Development
===========

The source is available on `Github <https://github.com/alisaifee/limits>`_

To get started

.. code:: console

   $ git clone git://github.com/alisaifee/limits.git
   $ cd limits
   $ pip install -r requirements/dev.txt

Since `limits` integrates with various backend storages, local development and running tests
requires a a working `docker & docker-compose installation <https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/>`_.

Running the tests will start the relevant containers automatically - but will leave them running
so as to not incur the overhead of starting up on each test run. To run the tests:

.. code:: console

   $ pytest

Once you're done - you will probably want to clean up the docker containers:

.. code:: console

   $ docker-compose down
